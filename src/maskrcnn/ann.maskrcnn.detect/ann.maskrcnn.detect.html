<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>ann.maskrcnn.detect</em> allows user to use a Mask R-CNN model to detect
features in georeferenced files and extract them either as areas or points.
The module creates a separate map for each class.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
The detection may be used for multiple files. However, all files for the
detection must be in one directory specified in the <em>images_directory</em>
parameter. Even when using only one image, the module finds it through this
parameter.

<p>
When detecting, you can use new names of classes. Classes in the model are not
referenced by their name, but by their order. It means that if the model was
trained with classes <em>corn,rice</em> and you use
<em>ann.maskrcnn.detect</em> with classes <em>zea,oryza</em>, zea areas will
present areas detected as corn and oryza areas will present areas detected as
rice.

<p>
If the file is georeferenced externally (by a worldfile or an <em>.aux.xml</em>
file), please use <em>-e</em> flag.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Detect buildings and lakes and import them as areas</h3>

<p>
In case the georeferencing is internal (GeoTIFF):

<div class="code"><pre>
ann.maskrcnn.detect images_directory=/home/user/Documents/georeferenced_images classes=buildings,lakes model=/home/user/Documents/logs/mask_rcnn_building_lakes_0100.h5 images_format=tif
</pre></div>

<p>
In case the georeferencing is external:

<div class="code"><pre>
ann.maskrcnn.detect images_directory=/home/user/Documents/georeferenced_images classes=buildings,lakes model=/home/user/Documents/logs/mask_rcnn_building_lakes_0100.h5 images_format=png -e
</pre></div>

<h3>Detect cottages and plattenbaus and import them as points</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
ann.maskrcnn.detect images_directory=/home/user/Documents/georeferenced_images classes=cottages,plattenbaus model=/home/user/Documents/logs/mask_rcnn_houses_0100.h5 images_format=tif output_type=point
</pre></div>
