<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em>ann.maskrcnn.detect</em> allows user to use a Mask R-CNN model to detect
features in georeferenced files. Files must be in one directory.

<h2>NOTES</h2>

<p>
When detecting, you can use new names of classes. Classes in the model are not
referenced by their name, but by their order. It means that if the model was
trained with classes <em>corn,rice</em> and you use
<em>ann.maskrcnn.detect</em> with classes <em>zea,oryza</em>, zea areas will
present areas detected as corn and oryza areas will present areas detected as
rice.

<p>
If the file is georeferenced externally, please use <em>-e</em> flag.

<h2>EXAMPLES</h2>

<h3>Detect buildings and lakes and import them as areas</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
ann.maskrcnn.detect images_directory=/home/user/Documents/georeferenced_images classes=buildings,lakes model=/home/user/Documents/logs/mask_rcnn_building_lakes_0100.h5 images_format=jpg
</pre></div>

<h3>Detect cottages and plattenbaus and import them as points</h3>

<div class="code"><pre>
ann.maskrcnn.detect images_directory=/home/user/Documents/georeferenced_images classes=cottages,plattenbaus model=/home/user/Documents/logs/mask_rcnn_houses_0100.h5 images_format=png output_type=point
</pre></div>
