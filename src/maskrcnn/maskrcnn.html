<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

Mask R-CNN tools allow the user to train his own model and use it for
a detection of objects, or to use a model provided by someone else. It can be
seen as a supervised classification using convolutional neural networks.

The training is done using module <em>ann.maskrcnn.train</em>. The user feeds
the module with training data consisting of images and masks for each instance
of intended classes, and gets a model. For difficult tasks and when not using
a pretrained model, the training may take even weeks; in case of a good
pretrained model and powerful PC with GPU support, the training could get good
results after 1 day and even less.

When the user has a model, it can be used for the detection.
<em>ann.maskrcnn.detect</em> detects classes learned during the training and
extracts from given images vectors corresponding to detected objects. Objects
can be extracted either as areas or points.
